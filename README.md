# AI Autocomplete Forms with Language Models

Welcome to our AI-powered Autocomplete Form project. This repository contains a novel UI component that leverages language models 
to provide an autocomplete feature for forms based on natural language input. It's a step towards making form interactions 
smarter and more intuitive.

## How It Works

The project integrates the capabilities of large language models, specifically OpenAI's models, to interpret and convert plain 
text into structured data that pre-fills a form. Here's the process:

1. **Text Input:** The user inputs descriptive text into an interface.
2. **API Call:** The text is sent to a backend service via an API.
3. **Language Model Processing:** The backend service utilizes a language model to parse the text and extract structured data 
according to a predefined schema.
4. **Autocomplete:** The form fields are automatically completed with the structured data, streamlining the form-filling process.

### Technical Stack:

- **Next.js**: For the frontend and API routes.
- **Chakra UI**: For the user interface components.
- **React Hook Form**: For managing form state.
- **Zod**: For schema validation and TypeScript type generation.
- **Langchain**: For interacting with OpenAI models.

### Repository Structure:

- `models/`: Contains Zod schemas for form data validation and typing.
- `components/`: React components including the form and autocomplete container.
- `pages/api/autocomplete/`: The API endpoint for the autocomplete feature.
- `server/`: Backend logic for communicating with OpenAI's API.

## Get Started
